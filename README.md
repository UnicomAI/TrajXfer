# CoTj

## 🧭 Description

**CoTj (Chain-of-Trajectories)** is a **graph-theoretic trajectory planning framework** for diffusion models. 
It upgrades the standard, fixed-step denoising schedules (System 1) into **condition-adaptive, optimally planned trajectories (System 2)**, enabling flexible, high-fidelity image generation under varying prompts and constraints.

CoTj establishes an **offline graph for each condition**, searches for optimal denoising paths, and supports both **fixed-step optimal sequences** and **adaptive-length planning** for fewer steps without sacrificing output quality. 
The full methodology, theoretical analysis, and experiments are detailed in a research work **currently under submission**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

CoTj can be directly used with the **Qwen-Image pipeline**. Example usage:

```python
from CoTj_pipeline_qwenimage import CoTjQwenImagePipeline
import os

model_path = '~/.cache/modelscope/hub/models/Qwen/Qwen-Image/'
mlp_path = './prompt_models/qwenimage_mlp_models/'
device = 'cuda:0'

pipe = None
cotj = CoTjQwenImagePipeline(model_path=model_path, mlp_path=mlp_path, pipe=pipe, device=device)

prompt = "A young female researcher wearing a dark blue Polo shirt with a red 'Unicom' logo on her chest, confidently smiling at the camera, writing with a black marker on the glass wall of a futuristic data center: 'CoTj enables generative AI to move from fixed, blind-step modes to intelligent, adaptive planning.'"

num_inference_steps = 10

# Baseline Euler sampling
pipe_image = cotj.get_pipe_image(prompt, 
                                 num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps, 
                                 width=1664, 
                                 height=928,
                                 seed=42)

# Fixed-Step Planning
prompt_cotj_image_fixed = cotj.get_prompt_cotj_image_fixed_step(prompt, 
                                                                num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps, 
                                                                width=1664, 
                                                                height=928,
                                                                seed=42)

# Adaptive-Length Planning
prompt_cotj_image_adaptive = cotj.get_prompt_cotj_image_adaptive_step(prompt, 
                                                                      inference_steps_max=50, 
                                                                      fidelity_target=0.99, 
                                                                      width=1664, 
                                                                      height=928,
                                                                      seed=42)

```
